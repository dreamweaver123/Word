<p>HTML author<!--THAT IS ANOTHER NON-dw comment--> Pam likes Dreamweaver for 
  it's website management features but has reservations about the GUI authoring 
  environment because of the empty character markup tags (e.g., &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) 
  that can sometimes result. To keep her HTML clean<!--that is a non-DW comment--> 
  and well-performing, she still codes most of her HTML manually. With the new 
  Clean Up HTML command, however, she knows she can now clean up those empty tags 
  prior to deploying her pages and is now doing more and more of her 
<!-- #BeginCustomObject --> This is a custom Object <!-- #EndCustomObject -->development 
within the GUI environment. Her productivity skyrockets! Website Javascript programmer 
Jane is instructed by website manager Jerry to implement a Dreamweaver Command 
that iterates through an HTML document and globally updates all FONT tags to some 
new look and feel. Jane easily extends the Clean Up HTML command to do this.

  unused<!-- #EndVariableLibraryItem --></p>
<p>Manager Jerry is fond of incorporating some of the latest HTML generated by 
  other tools in his site; he is dismayed with the superfluous tags found in some 
  of the HTML. He consolidates his entire site under Dreamweaver and uses the 
  Clean Up HTML command to ensure he deploys the tightest HTML possible. </p>
